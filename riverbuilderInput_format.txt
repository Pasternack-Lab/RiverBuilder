If one wants to use example inputs, s/he needs to #   delet the '#' at the start of paramenter lines.# - Bankfull depth can either be (A) user-defined or (B) calculated from the Critical Shields Stress and Median Sediment Size.# - Centerline Curvature can either be (A) user-defined or (B) calculate from centerline slope.# - Calculations of banks of channel are based on channel centerline; calculations of levels of valley are based on valley centerline.######################## GUIDELINES ######################### To ensure the program functions correctly, please abide by the following:# - Put each parameter or function in a seperate line.# - When providing an input involving pi, do so in the form of a*pi, where a is a constant. (EX: 2*pi, pi, pi/6, 3+pi)######################################## DOMAIN PARAMETERS (METERS) ######################################### These parameters initial the environment of the river; the follow will be an example input.# Datum=500# Length=1000# Valley Slope (Sv)=0.001######################################### CHANNEL PARAMETERS (METERS) ########################################## These parameters controls the inner channel of the river; the follow will be an example input.# Note that if "Inner Channel Depth Minimum" is set to 0, then the depth minimum will be # calculated based on median sediment size and critical shields stress.# Inner Channel Lateral Offset Minimum=30# Inner Channel Depth Minimum=2.11# Median Sediment Size (D50)=0# Critical Shields Stress (t*50)=0################################### CROSS SECTIONAL SHAPE #################################### These parameters handles the cross-sectional shape of inner channel. # AU = asymmetric U# SU = symmetric U# TZ(n) = triangle, trapezoid, rectangle#	n is the number of edges along the#	trapezoidal base of the cross section#	such that 0 <= n <= Channel XS Points# Triangle: n = 1# Trapezoid: 1 < n < Channel XS Points# Rectangle: n = Channel XS Points # The follow will be an example input.# Channel XS Points=21# Cross-Sectional Shape=SU# TZ(n)=20#################################### USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS ##################################### a = amplitude# f = frequency# ps = phase shift# w = wavelength# m = elliptic parameter, between 0 and 1, closer to 1, sharper # A mask is like a on and off switch to a periodic function.
